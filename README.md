Title: WeatherApp: A Python-Based Weather Application.      	

Abstract: WeatherApp is a Python project that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with real-time weather information. The application fetches data such as temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed for a specified city and presents it in a user-friendly manner. This project aims to create a simple yet functional weather application using Python and external APIs.

Requirements: 
1.	OpenWeatherMap API Key:
•	Sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to obtain an API key.
•	Entering the API key in the program to get the real-time data.
2.	Python Libraries:
•	Install the required requests library using the following command:
•	 





Project Outline: 
I. Introduction
•	Overview of WeatherApp and its purpose.
•	Introduction to OpenWeatherMap API.
II. Project Components
1.	API Integration:
•	Utilize OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
•	Integrate API key for authentication.
2.	User Interface (UI):
•	Choose a GUI framework.
•	Design user-friendly interface.
•	Implement user input for city selection.

Project Timeline: 
1.	Week 1: Project Setup and API Integration
•	Setting up the project structure.
•	Obtain OpenWeatherMap API key.
•	Implement the script to fetch and display weather data.
2.	Week 2: User Interface Enhancement
•	Exploring GUI frameworks for the weather application.
•	Integrate the script into a user-friendly interface.
•	Allow users to input city names through the GUI.
3.	Week 3: Additional Features
•	Add features like historical weather data or forecast information.
•	Explore options for unit conversion (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
•	Implement error handling for invalid input.
4.	Week 4: Documentation and Testing
•	Document the project, including the README file.
•	Write clear comments within the code.
•	Perform thorough testing to ensure the application's reliability.
5.	Week 5: Finalization and Deployment
•	Address any remaining issues or bugs.
•	Optimize code for performance.
•	Prepare the project for deployment.
•	Release the final version of WeatherApp.

Mapping of project with theoretical concepts: 
1. Data Types:
•	Application: The WeatherApp project involves handling various data types to store and present weather information. For example:
•	Numeric Data: Temperature, humidity, wind speed.
•	Text Data: City names, weather descriptions.
2. Conditional Statements and Loops:
•	Application: Conditional statements and loops are used in various aspects of the project:
•	User Input Handling: If statements to check for valid inputs.
•	Error Handling: Conditions for handling errors in user input.
•	Unit Conversion: Conditional statements for different unit options.
•	Data Retrieval: Loops for fetching and parsing weather data.
3. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
•	Application: WeatherApp leverages OOP principles for better code organization and modularity.
•	Class Creation: The project can have classes for UI components, data handling, and API integration.
•	Encapsulation: Data and methods related to specific functionalities can be encapsulated within classes.
•	Inheritance: If there are different types of weather data sources, inheritance could be used for a more flexible structure.

4. File Handling:
•	Application: The project may involve file handling for:
•	Storing API Keys: Securely storing and retrieving API keys.
•	Caching Data: Saving previous weather data to reduce API calls for frequently queried cities.
5. Internal and External Libraries:
•	Application: WeatherApp relies on external libraries to enhance its functionality.
•	Requests Library: Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
•	Tkinter or PyQt: GUI frameworks for creating a user-friendly interface.
•	JSON (Internal Library): Used for parsing API responses.
•	Explicit Reasons:
•	Requests Library: Essential for making API calls and retrieving real-time weather data.
•	Tkinter or PyQt: Required for creating a graphical user interface for users to interact with the application.
•	JSON: Used for parsing the JSON data received from the OpenWeatherMap API.
